# ⚡ Streamlit RAG Application

A powerful and interactive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with Streamlit. This tool supports multiple document formats (PDF, TXT, DOCX), enables chunking and retrieval using advanced techniques like ChromaDB, FAISS, and pgVector, and integrates with HuggingFace LLMs to generate answers from your uploaded documents.




## ✨ Features

- **Multi-format Document Upload**: Upload PDF, TXT, or DOCX files.
- **Customizable Text Chunking**: Choose from Recursive, Character, Token, and Sentence splitters.
- **Flexible Retrieval Techniques**:
  - Vector-based (ChromaDB, FAISS, pgVector)
  - Keyword-based (BM25, TF-IDF, LSI)
  - Hybrid (Combine vector + keyword)
- **LLM Integration**: Use HuggingFace-hosted models like Mistral-7B, Phi-4-mini, and more.
- **Interactive UI**: Built using Streamlit with real-time feedback and result display.



## 🧠 How It Works

1. Upload one or more documents.
2. Choose your desired text splitting strategy and retrieval method.
3. Select your embedding and LLM model.
4. Ask a question — get contextually accurate answers with sources!
